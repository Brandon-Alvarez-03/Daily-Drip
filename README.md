# Daily Drip

## Your daily source for water consciousness

---

Daily Drip is a web app created for the purpose of helping individuals connect with the world to understand the severity of water stress and scarcity and how they can make small changes in their daily lives to be more sustainable!

According to the United Nations, 733+ million people live in countries with high and critical levels of water stress [2019].

Additionally, only one quarter of reporting countries have >90% of their transboundary waters covered by operational arrangements[2020].

By appreciating water as a renewable yet not infinitely renewable resource we can help control the water we consume in our daily activity!
